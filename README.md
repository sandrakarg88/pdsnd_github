### Analysing bikeshare data
bikeshare.py is a code to analyze the data of bicycle-sharing systems.  

### Description
They allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. Current technologies  provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.
In this project, you are using data provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/). It's a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns.
You are able to compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

### Files used
